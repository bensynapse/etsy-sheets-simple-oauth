- ‚úÖ **Product Upload** - Bulk upload products with images
- ‚úÖ **Inventory Management** - Update prices and quantities in bulk
- ‚úÖ **Listing Deletion** - Bulk delete marked listings
- ‚úÖ **Order Management** - Import and track orders
- ‚úÖ **Progress Tracking** - Real-time progress bars for bulk operations

### Technical Features
- üîê Secure token storage using Google's PropertiesService
- üîÑ Automatic token refresh before expiration
- ‚è±Ô∏è Built-in rate limiting to respect API limits
- üìä Comprehensive error handling and logging
- üé® Clean, intuitive sidebar UI

## How It Works

Uses manual OAuth flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange):
1. Opens Etsy authorization in browser with localhost redirect
2. You copy the authorization code from URL
3. Paste it back in Google Sheets sidebar
4. Done! Full API access with all necessary scopes

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Etsy App
- Go to https://www.etsy.com/developers/
- Create new app
- Add redirect URI: `http://localhost`
- Save your **API Key** (Keystring)

### 2. Setup Google Sheets
- Create new Google Sheet
- Go to Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
- Delete default code
- Create these files:
  - **Code.gs** - Copy the Code.gs content
  - **Sidebar** (HTML file) - Copy the Sidebar.html content
- Save project (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

### 3. Use the Script
- Reload Google Sheet
- Click "Etsy API" menu ‚Üí "Open Control Panel"
- Follow the 3 steps in sidebar:
  1. Enter API Key
  2. Click "Connect to Etsy" and authorize
  3. Start managing your shop!

## OAuth Scopes

The integration requests these permissions:
- `listings_r` - Read your listings
- `listings_w` - Create and update listings
- `listings_d` - Delete listings
- `shops_r` - Read shop information
- `shops_w` - Update shop settings
- `transactions_r` - Read orders and receipts
- `email_r` - Get user email for identification

## API Endpoints Used

### Authentication
- `GET /v3/public/oauth/token` - Token exchange
- `POST /v3/public/oauth/token` - Token refresh

### Shop Management
- `GET /v3/application/users/me` - Current user info
- `GET /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}` - Shop details
- `PUT /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}` - Update shop

### Listing Operations
- `POST /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/listings` - Create listing
- `PATCH /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/listings/{listing_id}` - Update listing
- `DELETE /v3/application/listings/{listing_id}` - Delete listing
- `GET /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/listings` - Get listings

### Inventory Management
- `GET /v3/application/listings/{listing_id}/inventory` - Get inventory
- `PUT /v3/application/listings/{listing_id}/inventory` - Update inventory

### Image Management
- `POST /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/listings/{listing_id}/images` - Upload image

### Supporting Operations
- `GET /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/shipping-profiles` - Get shipping
- `POST /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/shipping-profiles` - Create shipping
- `GET /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/policies/return` - Get return policies
- `POST /v3/application/shops/{shop_id}/policies/return` - Create return policy

## Error Handling

The script handles common issues automatically:
- **Missing Shipping Profile** - Creates default profile
- **Missing Return Policy** - Creates default policy
- **Invalid Image URLs** - Skips and continues, saves as draft
- **Rate Limiting** - Built-in delays between requests
- **Token Expiration** - Automatic refresh

## Rate Limits

- 10,000 requests per day
- 10 requests per second
- Script includes 500ms-1s delays between operations
- Progress tracking shows current status

## Security

- API keys stored in ScriptProperties (app-level)
- OAuth tokens stored in UserProperties (user-level)
- Tokens never exposed in UI or logs
- Automatic token refresh before expiration

## Files

Just 2 simple files needed:
- **Code.gs** - Complete implementation (1627 lines)
- **Sidebar.html** - Clean UI interface (509 lines)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify API key is correct (not Client ID)
- Ensure redirect URI is exactly `http://localhost`
- Copy full authorization code including any trailing characters

### Upload Issues
- Check image URLs are accessible
- Verify taxonomy IDs are valid
- Ensure required fields are filled
- Check for special characters in text fields

### Permission Issues
- Disconnect and reconnect if scopes changed
- Ensure all requested permissions were approved
- Check API key has appropriate app permissions

## Why This Approach?

- **No Deployment Needed** - Works immediately after copy-paste
- **No Complex URLs** - Uses simple localhost redirect
- **User-Friendly** - Clear 3-step process
- **Fully Featured** - All shop management capabilities
- **Secure** - Follows OAuth 2.0 + PKCE best practices
- **Maintainable** - Clean, documented code

That's it! Simple OAuth without the complexity, but with all the power you need to manage your Etsy shop.
